    Authentication is attempted in the following order of priority:

        - The ``pkey`` or ``key_filename`` passed in (if any)

            - ``key_filename`` may contain OpenSSH public certificate paths
            as well as regular private-key paths; when files ending in
            ``-cert.pub`` are found, they are assumed to match a private
            key, and both components will be loaded. (The private key
            itself does *not* need to be listed in ``key_filename`` for
            this to occur - *just* the certificate.)

        - Any key we can find through an SSH agent
        - Any "id_rsa", "id_dsa" or "id_ecdsa" key discoverable in
            ``~/.ssh/``

            - When OpenSSH-style public certificates exist that match an
            existing such private key (so e.g. one has ``id_rsa`` and
            ``id_rsa-cert.pub``) the certificate will be loaded alongside
            the private key and used for authentication.

        `.BadHostKeyException` -- if the server's host key could not be
